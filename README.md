## Problem of stable diffusion webui

Stable diffusion webui provides a powerful tool for AI image generation. However, the webui api has some limitations:

1. a blocking REST api call, which might take more than 30s to return the final value. Most gateways don't allow such long blocking time on api call.
2. webui api is a single thread process. Once the thread is occupied, other webui api will fail. (Even though there is a multi thread mode in stable diffusion webui)

This repo is aiming to solve the above problems.
